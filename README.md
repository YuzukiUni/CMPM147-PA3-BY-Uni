# Chess Board: Static but Dynamic World!

### Designed by Uni Huang

### Shape:

 The Square with "X" (Main Background).
 The Group of Squares.
 The Group of Circles.
 The shape of "+", circle and Square (Random Color)  when clicking.

### Description

The Chessboard with two groups: Circles Vs Squares. All of them are either black or white. However, the auto tile and the draw click have color randomly.

Shape might be boring and monotonous, but if it has wonderful colors, it will become vividly.

### Artist Statement
From PA3, I will try to make something different from other. According to my draft, I will like to make the map like the chessboard (Either Black and White based). The Shapes (3 or more in the draft) are also look like the "chess". Everything is black and white-only, except tiles and points when clicked.

I think I partially achieved my goal. The shape is simple but symmetrical. and I think I achieve the goal that I want to make.
However, It is difficult for me to combine more than 3 shapes with auto tile. I try to make 4 shapes , but the result shows very weird and has some bugs. So in the end I give up. Hope I can learn more about autotiling for fixing this problem.

### Special Thanks

My friend ZhiBin Huang, he gives me a suggestion about how to make autotiling by using "noise".

Instructor ! I learned a lot idea for how to do PA3 from class video ("noise", shape design).
